- **Basic Python knowledge**

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone or navigate to this folder**

   ```bash
   cd examples/_aiwithbrandon
   ```

2. **Choose your learning path**
   - **Beginners**: Start with `_adk-crash-course/1-basic-agent/`
   - **Intermediate**: Try `adk-mcp-tutorial/` or `adk-rag-agent/`
   - **Advanced**: Explore `adk-voice-agent/` or `youtube-thumbnail-agent/`

3. **Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   # source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   ```

4. **Follow the specific README in each project folder**

## üìö Beginner's Guide

### Step 1: Watch the Video Tutorial

Start with the [ADK Crash Course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4VFL9nIaIA&t=9496s) to understand the core concepts and see live implementations.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment

1. **Install Google ADK**

   ```bash
   pip install google-adk
   ```

2. **Get your Google API Key**
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
   - Create an API key for Gemini
   - Set it as an environment variable: `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here`

3. **Set up Google Cloud (for advanced examples)**
   - Create a Google Cloud project
   - Enable Vertex AI API
   - Set up authentication

### Step 3: Start Learning

Begin with the crash course examples in order:

1. **Basic Agent** - Learn agent fundamentals
2. **Tool Agent** - Add custom capabilities
3. **LiteLLM Agent** - Work with multiple LLM providers
4. Continue through the numbered examples...

### Step 4: Build Your Own Project

Once you've completed the crash course, try building:

- A personal assistant agent
- A domain-specific chatbot
- A multi-agent workflow for your use case

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Setup Requirements

Most examples require these dependencies:

```bash
pip install google-adk
pip install python-dotenv
pip install pydantic
```

Additional requirements vary by project - check each folder's `requirements.txt`.

## üîß Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in each project directory with:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here  # (if needed)
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your_project_id  # (for Vertex AI examples)
```
