# Product Requirements Document: Academic Research Assistant Agent

## 1. Vision & Introduction

To accelerate academic research by providing a personalized, AI-powered assistant that automates the discovery of relevant and recent scholarly literature. This agent will help researchers stay at the forefront of their field, identify novel connections, and save significant time on literature reviews.

## 2. The Problem

The sheer volume of new academic publications makes it nearly impossible for researchers to keep up with all relevant developments in their field. The process of manually searching, filtering, and reading papers to find truly impactful work is tedious, time-consuming, and often incomplete. Researchers need a more efficient way to discover papers that are directly related to their specific line of inquiry and build upon their previous work.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **Academic Researchers & Scientists**: Established professionals seeking to stay current and find inspiration for new projects.
*   **PhD Students & Postdoctoral Fellows**: Early-career researchers who need to conduct comprehensive literature reviews for their thesis and publications.
*   **R&D Professionals in Industry**: Corporate researchers who need to track academic breakthroughs relevant to their work.

## 4. Agent Persona & Principles

*   **Collaborative**: Acts as an intelligent partner, not just a tool.
*   **Insightful**: Goes beyond simple keyword matching to find thematic and methodological connections.
*   **Accurate**: Prioritizes relevance and relies on reputable academic sources.
*   **Efficient**: Delivers concise, well-structured, and actionable information.

## 5. Core Workflow (User Journey)

1.  **Onboarding**: The user initiates a conversation with the agent.
2.  **Input**: The agent requests two key pieces of information:
    *   A primary **research topic** or keyword (e.g., "quantum machine learning").
    *   A link to the user's public profile (e.g., Google Scholar, ORCID) or a list of their key publications.
3.  **Profiling (Internal Analysis)**: The `research_profiler_agent` is invoked. It accesses the user's profile, scrapes the titles and abstracts of their work, and distills a set of core concepts, keywords, and methodologies that define the user's expertise.
4.  **Searching (External Data Gathering)**: The `academic_search_agent` is invoked. It uses the user's research topic and the keywords from the profiling step to perform targeted searches on academic databases (Google Scholar, arXiv, PubMed, etc.). It filters for recent publications and retrieves the titles, authors, and abstracts of the most relevant results.
5.  **Analysis (Comparative Synthesis)**: The `comparison_agent` is invoked. It takes the user's profile data and the newly found papers as input. Its prompts guide it to:
    *   Identify thematic links between the new research and the user's past work.
    *   Highlight papers that use novel methodologies the user might find interesting.
    *   Pinpoint findings that support or contradict the user's previous results.
6.  **Reporting**: The agent synthesizes the analysis into a final report, delivered as a curated and annotated bibliography. For each suggested paper, it will include a brief summary and a "Relevance Note" explaining *why* this paper is important for the user.

## 6. Key Modules & Technical Architecture

The system will follow a multi-agent architecture, orchestrated by a root agent.

*   **`academic_research_root_agent`**: The orchestrator that manages the workflow.
*   **`research_profiler_agent` (Sub-Agent)**:
    *   **Tool: `profile_scraper_tool`**: A new tool to scrape web pages (like Google Scholar) to extract publication details.
*   **`academic_search_agent` (Sub-Agent)**:
    *   Reuses the existing web-browsing capabilities but is guided by prompts to use academic search engines.
*   **`comparison_agent` (Sub-Agent)**:
    *   Uses LLM reasoning, guided by highly specific prompts, to perform the comparative analysis. No new tools are required.

## 7. Success Metrics

*   **Quality of Recommendations**: Percentage of recommended papers the user marks as "highly relevant."
*   **Time Saved**: User-reported estimate of time saved on literature review per week.
*   **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of user requests that result in a successfully generated report.

## 8. Future Scope (V2.0)

*   **Trend Analysis**: Identify emerging trends or "hot topics" in the user's field.
*   **Full-Text Analysis**: Ingest full PDF versions of papers for deeper analysis.
*   **Grant Proposal Assistant**: Suggest relevant papers to cite in a grant proposal based on its topic.
*   **Automated Alerts**: Set up a recurring job to notify the user of new, relevant papers weekly.
