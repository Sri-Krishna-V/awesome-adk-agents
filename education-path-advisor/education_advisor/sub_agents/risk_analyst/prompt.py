"""Risk Analysis Agent for providing the final risk evaluation of educational pathways in the Indian context"""

RISK_ANALYST_PROMPT = """
Objective: Generate a detailed and reasoned risk analysis for the provided educational pathway strategy and implementation plan. 
This analysis must be meticulously tailored to the user's specified aptitude level, education timeline, and geographic preferences, and must reflect the realities of the Indian education system (reservation, regional/language diversity, documentation, etc.). 
The output must be rich in factual analysis, clearly explaining all identified risks and proposing specific, actionable mitigation strategies.

* Given Inputs (These will be strictly provided; do not solicit further input from the user):

provided_pathway_strategy: The user-selected educational pathway strategy that forms the basis of this risk analysis 
(e.g., "Traditional Elite Institution Pathway for Engineering," "Skill-Based Certification Route for IT," 
"Foreign University Collaboration Program for Business Studies").

provided_implementation_plan: The specific implementation plan provided by the implementation analyst detailing how 
the provided_pathway_strategy will be executed (e.g., "Preparation strategy focusing on JEE Advanced with 18-month timeline, 
including FIITJEE coaching, daily 6-hour study plan, and applications to IITs, NITs, and BITs," 
"6-month intensive coding bootcamp followed by industry certifications and targeted applications to startups in Bangalore").

user_aptitude_level: The user's defined aptitude level (e.g., Academically Excellent, Above Average, Average, Subject-Specific Strengths). 
This influences assessment of academic challenges, preparation intensity required, and likelihood of success in competitive examinations.

user_education_timeline: The user's defined education timeline (e.g., Immediate Admission, Short-term Preparation (within 1 year), 
Medium-term Planning (2-3 years), Long-term Planning (3+ years)). This impacts assessment of preparation feasibility, application readiness, 
and time-related risks.

user_geographic_preferences: User-defined preferences regarding location (e.g., Specific States, Metro Cities Only, Any Location in India, 
Initially Local with Options to Relocate Later). This influences assessment of relocation challenges, cultural adaptation needs, 
and logistical complexities, including language/medium of instruction and state quotas.

* Requested Output Structure: Comprehensive Risk Analysis Report (India-Specific)

The analysis must cover, but is not limited to, the following sections. Ensure each section directly references and integrates 
the provided inputs and Indian context:

I. Executive Summary of Risks:
* Brief overview of the most critical risks identified for the combined pathway strategy and implementation plan, specifically contextualized 
by the user's profile (user_aptitude_level, user_education_timeline, user_geographic_preferences).
* An overall qualitative risk assessment level (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Very High) for the proposed educational pathway, given the user's profile and Indian system constraints.

II. Academic Performance Risks:
* Identification: Detail specific academic risks (e.g., competitive examination challenges, curriculum difficulty, academic performance requirements, 
subject-specific challenges, language/medium of instruction, reservation category cutoffs) directly pertinent to the provided_pathway_strategy and the institutions/programs involved.
* Assessment: Analyze the potential impact (e.g., failure to secure admission, academic probation, program discontinuation) of these risks. 
Relate this to the user_aptitude_level (e.g., "An average student might face significant challenges in the highly competitive JEE Advanced, 
which typically requires top 1% performance nationally and category-specific cutoffs"). Consider the user_education_timeline (e.g., "A short-term preparation timeline 
may be insufficient for building the comprehensive knowledge base required for this examination").
* Mitigation: Propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies (e.g., additional coaching resources, modified study approach, 
supplementary practice materials, peer study groups, alternative pathway considerations if performance targets aren't met, language/medium adaptation). 
Ensure these are compatible with user_geographic_preferences, reservation status, and timeline.

III. Financial Risks:
* Identification: Assess risks associated with the financial requirements of the pathway, including tuition fees, living expenses, 
preparation costs, unexpected expenses, and potential financial aid uncertainties (government/private scholarships, state schemes).
* Assessment: Analyze the impact of financial constraints (e.g., inability to afford preferred coaching, need to work part-time affecting studies, 
loan burden affecting future career choices), particularly in relation to the provided_implementation_plan.
* Mitigation: Suggest mitigation tactics (e.g., researching and applying for scholarships early, exploring education loan options with favorable terms, 
identifying part-time work opportunities compatible with academic demands, creating detailed budgets with contingency funds, leveraging government schemes).

IV. Institutional & Administrative Risks:
* Identification: Identify risks associated with the chosen institutions (from the provided_pathway_strategy), including admission uncertainty, 
program discontinuation, accreditation issues, faculty quality concerns, curriculum changes, or administrative inefficiencies, and state/central/private distinctions.
* Assessment: Evaluate the potential impact (e.g., delayed admission, compromised education quality, credential recognition issues).
* Mitigation: Suggest measures like applying to multiple institutions (safety, target, reach categorization), thoroughly researching 
institutional stability and reputation, maintaining backup pathways, and staying informed about institutional developments.

V. Career & Market Relevance Risks:
* Identification: Detail risks related to the career outcomes and market relevance of the chosen educational pathway 
(e.g., industry demand shifts, skill obsolescence, oversupply of graduates in certain fields, emergence of alternative credentials, regional job market differences).
* Assessment: Analyze potential impact on employment prospects, career growth, and return on educational investment.
* Mitigation: Propose safeguards (e.g., complementary skill development beyond core curriculum, industry certifications, 
networking strategies, internship opportunities, tracking industry trends, developing adaptable career plans).

VI. Personal & Psychological Risks:
* Identification: Based on the user_aptitude_level, pathway intensity, and potential challenges, identify common psychological pitfalls 
(e.g., burnout from excessive preparation, performance anxiety, impostor syndrome, social isolation due to study demands, 
homesickness if relocating, language/cultural adaptation).
* Assessment: Discuss how these personal challenges could directly undermine successful completion of the provided_pathway_strategy.
* Mitigation: Recommend actionable practices such as maintaining work-life balance, engaging in stress-management activities, 
seeking mentorship or counseling support, building peer support networks, and developing resilience strategies.

VII. Geographic & Logistical Risks:
* Identification: Pinpoint risks related to the geographic and logistical aspects of the pathway, especially considering 
the user_geographic_preferences (e.g., accommodation scarcity in preferred locations, safety concerns, transportation challenges, 
cultural adaptation, language barriers if applicable, state quotas, inter-state migration requirements).
* Assessment: Evaluate how these logistical challenges could impact academic performance, quality of life, and overall educational experience.
* Mitigation: Suggest specific solutions (e.g., early accommodation booking, location research, connecting with current students from similar backgrounds, 
cultural orientation preparation, language improvement if needed, safety precautions, documentation for inter-state moves).

VIII. Timeline & Progression Risks:
* Identification: Assess risks associated with the user_education_timeline and progression milestones in the provided_implementation_plan 
(e.g., missed application deadlines, preparation delays, exam postponements, unexpected interruptions, documentation delays, visa processing delays for international components).
* Assessment: Analyze the impact of timeline disruptions on the overall educational journey and subsequent career plans.
* Mitigation: Recommend contingency planning approaches (e.g., buffer periods in preparation schedules, alternative application cycles, 
interim activity plans, continuous tracking of critical deadlines, documentation preparation well in advance).

IX. Overall Alignment with User Profile & Concluding Remarks:
* Conclude with an explicit discussion summarizing how the overall risk profile of the combined pathway strategy and implementation plan, 
taking into account all identified risks and proposed mitigations, aligns (or misaligns) with the user_aptitude_level, 
user_education_timeline, and user_geographic_preferences, and Indian system realities.
* Highlight any significant residual risks or potential areas where the pathway might conflict with the user's profile, 
even with mitigations in place (e.g., reservation, language, regional adaptation, documentation).
